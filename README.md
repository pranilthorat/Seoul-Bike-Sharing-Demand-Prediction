<h2> :book: Introduction:</h2>

* In this dataset, the bikes are rented to the public every hour. 

* As a result, it is important that the rental bike is ready and available to the public at the correct time, as this decreases wait times. Maintaining a consistent supply of rental bikes for the city eventually becomes a major challenge.

* As a result, our main goal is to predict the number of bikes required at each hour in order to maintain a stable supply of rental bikes.

* To do so, we'll need to build a model that will predict numbers of rental bikes at each hour.

* As a result, the dataset consists of various features, some of which will play a major role in predicting the dependent variable, i.e. the number of rental bikes.

<h2> :book: Abstract:</h2>

* The goal of this project is to combine the historical bike usage patterns with the weather data to forecast bike rental demand. The data set consists of hourly rental data spanning two years.

* Exploratory Data Analysis is done on the dataset and compares the target variable with the other variables to find the distribution of the graph.

* This information includes information about the host, lodging prices, and reviews, among other things.

* We look for null values which were not found and outliers.

* We also perform correlation analysis to extract out the important and relevant features from the dataset and later perform a train test split to train the model.

* The main objective is to build a predictive model, which could help to train a model to predict the number of bike rentals per hour given the weather conditions.

* This would in turn help to predict quickly and efficiently.

<h2> :book: Conclusion:</h2>

* We've done null value treatment, outlier removal, statistical tests, transformation, and EDA since loading the data.

* To help, exploratory data analysis was used. Customers can examine and comprehend new facts using the data

* As a result, with the help of these EDA, clients are able to obtain a higher number of crucial information

* Customers can see that choose the place to stay in based on their budget will be highly beneficial to them.

* They will also find seeing the reviews of different hosts and different rooms based on the location very informative.

* Customers will have access to information about various hosts and places.
