<h2> :book: Introduction:</h2>

* Airbnb is an online marketplace for lodging, principally homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities based in the United States. The platform can be accessed by a website or a mobile app. Airbnb is a shortened version of AirBedandBreakfast.com, which was its original name.

* From 2011 through 2019, the data we have is limited to New York City. From this data, we may extract some key information about various hosts and locations. The main goal is to assist our customers in making decisions about different types of rooms in different places. Customers will be able to know more about different hosts, such as the cost of a room per night and reviews of different hosts. Customers may be able to form an opinion on the host's service as a result of analysis. Customers will be able to choose a room type and spend the night in room depending on their budget.
